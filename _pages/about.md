I am currently a PostDoc. at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I received my PhD degree from [School of Mathematics](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/) of [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) under the supervision of Prof. [Naihuan Jing](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/jing/) in June 2024. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.nenu.edu.cn/) of [Northeast Normal University](https://www.nenu.edu.cn/) in June 2018.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in Algebraic Combinatorics and Representation Theory. In addition, I am also interested in Vertex Operators of Symmetric Functions.
